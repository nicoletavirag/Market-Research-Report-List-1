<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forensic Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Intensity Forensic Light Source</li><li>Medium and Low Intensity Forensic Light Source</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Forensic lighting market types include high intensity forensic light sources, medium intensity forensic light sources, and low intensity forensic light sources. High intensity forensic light sources generate a powerful light beam, enabling the detection of hard-to-see evidence such as body fluids or fingerprints. Medium intensity forensic light sources offer a more moderate light output, suitable for capturing fingerprints or examining fibers. Low intensity forensic light sources emit a lower level of illumination, mainly used for locating evidence like blood stains or gunshot residue but without altering the scene.</p></p>
