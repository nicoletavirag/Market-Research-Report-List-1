<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disk Resistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thick Film</li><li>Thin Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disk resistors are types of resistors used in electronic circuits for controlling the flow of electric current. Two common types of disk resistors are thick film and thin film resistors. Thick film resistors are made using a thick layer of conductive material applied to a ceramic substrate. They are cost-effective and suitable for high power applications. On the other hand, thin film resistors use a thin metal film applied to a ceramic or glass substrate. They offer higher accuracy, stability, and lower noise levels, making them ideal for precise electronic applications.</p></p>
