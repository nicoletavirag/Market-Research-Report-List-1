<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kitchen Hood Fire Suppression Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Trigger</li><li>Thermal Trigger</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Kitchen Hood Fire Suppression Systems market consists of two types: Manual Trigger and Thermal Trigger. Manual Trigger systems require human intervention to activate them in case of a fire. These systems have a switch or button that needs to be pressed to release the fire suppression agents. On the other hand, Thermal Trigger systems are activated automatically when the temperature reaches a certain threshold. They use sensors or fusible links that detect heat and trigger the release of fire-suppressing substances. Both types serve the purpose of extinguishing fires in kitchen hoods, but differ in their activation methods.</p></p>
