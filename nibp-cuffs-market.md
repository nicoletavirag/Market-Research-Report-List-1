<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NIBP Cuffs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NIBP cuffs, also known as blood pressure cuffs, are available in two main market types: disposable and reusable. Disposable cuffs are designed for single-use purposes and are discarded after each patient's blood pressure measurement to prevent cross-contamination. Reusable cuffs, on the other hand, can be used multiple times after proper sterilization between patients. Both types serve the purpose of measuring blood pressure accurately, but their usage differs based on the need for either single-use convenience or long-term cost-effectiveness and ecological impact.</p></p>
