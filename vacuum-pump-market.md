<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet vacuum pumps</li><li>Dry vacuum pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vacuum pump market consists of two main types: wet vacuum pumps and dry vacuum pumps. Wet vacuum pumps utilize a liquid, typically oil, to create a seal and generate the vacuum. This type of pump is commonly used in applications where a high vacuum level is required. On the other hand, dry vacuum pumps do not require liquid to create a seal and operate using a non-contact technology. They are generally preferred for applications where a clean vacuum is necessary or when handling hazardous substances.</p></p>
