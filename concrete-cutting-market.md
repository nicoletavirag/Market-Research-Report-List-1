<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Cutting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Handheld-Cut-Off</li><li>Walk-Behind-Push</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The concrete cutting market consists of two primary types: handheld cut-off and walk-behind push machines. Handheld cut-off machines are compact and portable, allowing operators to make precise cuts on small to medium-sized concrete surfaces. Walk-behind push machines, on the other hand, are larger and designed for cutting larger areas of concrete, such as pavements or floors. These machines are pushed and guided by operators to create straight and controlled cuts. Both types serve different purposes, catering to different concrete cutting needs based on the scale of the project.</p></p>
