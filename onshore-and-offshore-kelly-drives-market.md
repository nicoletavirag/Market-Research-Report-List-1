<p><strong>The Onshore and Offshore Kelly Drives Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Onshore and offshore Kelly drives are used in the oil and gas industry for drilling operations. Onshore Kelly drives are used for drilling on land, where the drilling rig is fixed and the well is drilled vertically from the surface. Offshore Kelly drives, on the other hand, are used for drilling operations in marine environments, such as drilling for oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. These drives are specifically designed to withstand the challenging conditions of offshore drilling, including the corrosive saltwater environment and dynamic forces caused by sea currents and waves.</p></p>
