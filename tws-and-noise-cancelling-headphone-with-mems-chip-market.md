<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TWS and Noise-Cancelling Headphone with MEMS Chip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction</li><li>Active Noise Cancellation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passive Noise Reduction in TWS and Noise-Cancelling Headphones refers to the design and materials used to block out external noise. It relies on physical barriers like earbud shape and tight seal, reducing noise passively. On the other hand, Active Noise Cancellation uses a MEMS (Microelectromechanical System) chip to actively analyze ambient sounds and generate anti-noise signals. These signals cancel out external noise, providing a more immersive and quieter listening experience. Both these market types aim to enhance sound quality by minimizing unwanted noise, but active noise cancellation offers a more effective and advanced solution.</p></p>
