<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whole Virus Vaccines</li><li>Split Virus Vaccines</li><li>Subunit Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Market Types include whole virus vaccines, split virus vaccines, and subunit vaccines. Whole virus vaccines use a weakened or inactivated form of the virus to stimulate an immune response. Split virus vaccines are made by treating the virus with chemicals to break it into fragments, which are then used for vaccination. Subunit vaccines only contain specific components of the virus, such as proteins. All three types aim to provide protection against pandemic influenza by stimulating the production of antibodies that can efficiently neutralize the virus.</p></p>
