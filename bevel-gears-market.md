<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bevel Gears Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Bevel Gears</li><li>Spiral Bevel Gear</li><li>Zerol bevel gears</li><li>Hypoid bevel gears</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bevel gears are categorized into four types: straight bevel gears, spiral bevel gears, Zerol bevel gears, and hypoid bevel gears. Straight bevel gears have straight tooth lines and intersect at the gear's axis, providing high efficiency but also noise and vibration. Spiral bevel gears have curved teeth that gradually meet at the gear's axis, ensuring smoother operation with less noise. Zerol bevel gears are similar to spiral bevel gears but have a spiral angle of zero, offering improved tooth contact and reduced noise. Hypoid bevel gears have non-intersecting axes, allowing more compact designs and greater load-bearing capacity.</p></p>
