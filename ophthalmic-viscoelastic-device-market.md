<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cohesive OVDs</li><li>Dispersive OVDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Devices (OVDs) are used during various eye surgeries to protect intraocular tissues and maintain adequate space. There are two main types of OVDs: cohesive and dispersive. Cohesive OVDs are highly viscous and have a strong molecular structure, allowing them to stay in cohesive masses in the eye. They are ideal for maintaining space and protecting the corneal endothelium. Dispersive OVDs, on the other hand, are less viscous and tend to spread thinly. They provide excellent tamponade and protect delicate ocular structures during surgical procedures.</p></p>
