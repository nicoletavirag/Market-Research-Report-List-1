<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Plethysmography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Body</li><li>Respiratory Organs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Animal plethysmography is a technique used to measure changes in the volume of an organ or body part. There are two main types of animal plethysmography: body and respiratory organs. Body plethysmography involves measuring changes in overall body volume, such as in the case of water displacement. Respiratory organ plethysmography measures changes in the volume of specific organs involved in respiration, such as the lungs. Both types of plethysmography are important in studying various physiological functions in animals.</p></p>
