<p><p>An artificial heart-lung machine, also known as cardiopulmonary bypass machine, is a medical device used during open-heart surgery to temporarily take over the functions of the heart and lungs. It ensures the circulation of oxygenated blood throughout the body while the heart is stopped or undergoes surgery. The machine pumps and oxygenates the blood, removes carbon dioxide, and maintains normal temperature and blood pressure.</p><p>The artificial heart-lung machine market is expected to experience significant growth during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, along with the rising number of open-heart surgeries, is the primary factor driving the market growth. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. This has led to an increased demand for artificial heart-lung machines during cardiac surgeries.</p><p>Moreover, advancements in technology have led to the development of more advanced and efficient artificial heart-lung machines. These machines offer enhanced monitoring capabilities, improved safety features, and reduced risk of complications during surgeries. These technological advancements are further propelling the market growth.</p><p>Additionally, the increasing adoption of minimally invasive cardiac surgeries is also contributing to the growth of the market. Minimally invasive techniques reduce the need for traditional open-heart surgeries, but they still require the use of artificial heart-lung machines. This increasing preference for minimally invasive procedures is expected to drive the demand for these machines.</p><p>In conclusion, the artificial heart-lung machine market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in technology, and the rising adoption of minimally invasive cardiac surgeries.</p></p>
