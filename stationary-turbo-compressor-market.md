<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Turbo Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stroke</li><li>Multi Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary turbo compressors are widely used in various industries for compressing gases. There are two main types of these compressors: single stroke and multi-stroke. </p><p>In single stroke compressors, the compression process occurs in a single stroke of the piston or rotor, resulting in higher energy efficiency and lower maintenance requirements. These compressors are preferred for applications where a continuous and steady flow of compressed gas is required.</p><p>In contrast, multi-stroke compressors utilize multiple strokes of the piston or rotor to compress the gas, allowing for greater flexibility in adjusting the compression ratio and handling varying loads. This makes them suitable for applications where gas flow and pressure requirements fluctuate.</p></p>
