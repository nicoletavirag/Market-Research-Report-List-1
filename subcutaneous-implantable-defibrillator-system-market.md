<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Zone</li><li>Dual Zone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator System market consists of two main types: Single Zone and Dual Zone. In a Single Zone system, the defibrillator is programmed to deliver therapy only in a specific zone of the heart, usually the ventricles, where abnormal rhythms occur. This type of system is suitable for patients with primary ventricular arrhythmias. In contrast, a Dual Zone system is capable of detecting abnormalities in both the ventricles and atria of the heart and delivering appropriate therapy accordingly. This type of system is utilized for patients with multi-chamber arrhythmias.</p></p>
