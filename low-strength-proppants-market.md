<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Strength Proppants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Proppant</li><li>Ultra-low Strength Proppant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low strength proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing to prop open fractures in the rock formation to allow oil and gas to flow more easily. Conventional proppants are typically made of materials like sand or ceramic and have moderate strength. Ultra-low strength proppants are specifically designed to have even lower strength than conventional proppants, allowing for easier flowback of fracturing fluid and minimizing damage to the formation. Both types of proppants play a crucial role in optimizing the production of oil and gas.</p></p>
