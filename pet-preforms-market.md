<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Preforms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-crystallized Neck Finish Preforms</li><li>Crystallized Neck Finish Preforms</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PET preforms are widely used in the packaging industry for the production of bottles and containers. There are two main types of preforms based on neck finish: non-crystallized and crystallized neck finish preforms. Non-crystallized neck finish preforms are characterized by their lower degree of crystallinity, resulting in a more flexible and convenient sealing solution. On the other hand, crystallized neck finish preforms have a higher degree of crystallinity, making them stiffer and more suitable for products that require a tighter seal. The choice between these types depends on the specific requirements of the packaging application.</p></p>
