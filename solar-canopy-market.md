<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Canopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin Film</li><li>Crystalline Silicon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Solar Canopy market comprises two main types: Thin Film and Crystalline Silicon. Thin Film technology involves a layer of photovoltaic material being applied onto a substrate, making it lightweight and flexible. This type is more cost-effective but has lower energy conversion efficiency. On the other hand, Crystalline Silicon technology uses a more rigid structure, consisting of wafers made from crystalline silicon. This type offers higher energy conversion efficiency and durability, but is generally more expensive. Both types contribute to the growing popularity of solar canopies as sustainable energy solutions.</p></p>
