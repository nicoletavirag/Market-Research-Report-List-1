<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resistance Thermometry Bridges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alternating Current</li><li>Direct Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resistance thermometry bridges are used to measure temperature by evaluating the resistance change in a sensor. There are two main types of bridges: Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) bridges. The AC bridge uses a Wheatstone bridge configuration and measures the ratio of two resistances to calculate temperature. On the other hand, a DC bridge measures the voltage across a resistor and compares it to a reference value to determine temperature. Both bridges are widely used in industrial and scientific applications to accurately measure temperature.</p></p>
