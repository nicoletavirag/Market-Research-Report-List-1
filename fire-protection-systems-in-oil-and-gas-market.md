<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Systems in Oil and Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Control Type</li><li>Decentralized Control Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the oil and gas industry, fire protection systems play a crucial role in ensuring safety. Centralized control type systems involve a centralized control room where all fire detection and suppression devices are interconnected and monitored. This allows for quicker response and coordination in case of emergencies. On the other hand, decentralized control type systems have separate control panels at different locations, allowing for independent operation of fire protection devices. This type of system is suitable for smaller or dispersed facilities where centralized control may not be practical.</p></p>
