<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Electrocardiographs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Chanels</li><li>Single Chanel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Veterinary electrocardiographs are used to monitor the heart's electrical activity in animals. Multiple channel electrocardiographs allow for the simultaneous recording of multiple leads, providing a more comprehensive view of the heart's function. On the other hand, single channel electrocardiographs only record from one lead at a time. Multiple channel electrocardiographs are generally more expensive but offer more detailed information, while single channel electrocardiographs are simpler and more cost-effective for basic monitoring purposes. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring cardiac conditions in animals.</p></p>
