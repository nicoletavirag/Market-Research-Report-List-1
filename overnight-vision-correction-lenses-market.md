Additionally, the desire for improved aesthetics and the ability to participate in sports and other activities without the hindrance of glasses or contact lenses contribute to the market growth.</p><p>However, the market is not without challenges. The high cost of Ortho-K lenses, the need for routine follow-ups with eye care professionals, and potential risks associated with improper lens care or fit are some factors that may hinder market growth.</p><p>Overall, the Overnight Vision Correction Lenses market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years, with a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7% during the forecast period. As technology and research continue to advance in this field, the market is likely to expand further, offering a compelling alternative for individuals seeking vision correction without the need for surgery or daytime corrective eyewear.</p></p>
