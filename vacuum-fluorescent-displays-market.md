<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Fluorescent Displays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Statically Driven Displays</li><li>Dynamically Driven Displays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD) offer different types of displays based on their driving mechanism. Statically Driven Displays are controlled by direct driving of each individual segment. This allows for simple implementation but limits the display's complexity. On the other hand, Dynamically Driven Displays use fewer control lines by employing multiplexing techniques, allowing for more complex displays. However, this approach may introduce potential flickering issues. Both types play a significant role in the VFD market, providing options depending on the desired display complexity and implementation design.</p></p>
