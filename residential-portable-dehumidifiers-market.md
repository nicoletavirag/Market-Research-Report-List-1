<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Portable Dehumidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compressor Type Dehumidifiers</li><li>Desiccant Type Dehumidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Residential portable dehumidifiers are devices used to reduce humidity levels in homes. There are two main types: compressor type dehumidifiers and desiccant type dehumidifiers. Compressor type dehumidifiers work by drawing air into the unit, cooling it, and collecting the condensation in a water tank. These are generally more effective for large spaces or high humidity regions. Desiccant type dehumidifiers use a moisture-absorbing material (like silica gel) to remove moisture from the air. These are often used in colder environments or for smaller areas. Both types help prevent mold, mildew, and improve indoor air quality.</p></p>
